<h1>STOHN CORE [SOH]</h1>

Stohn is a cryptocurrency Bitcoin fork with modified block parameters. Stohn Core is an open source software that allows anyone to operate a node in the Stohn blockchain network and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work mining.

Ports
=====================================

Stohn Core by default uses port `37218` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `32717` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet |
| :------- | ------: | ------: |
| RPC     |   32717 |   47217 |
| P2P     |   37218 |   47218 |
